# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe for 2 players made in Python3


## About
Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.



## More Advanced Tic Tac Toe
A relatively simple game usually played on a grid of 3 x 3 squares, tic-tac-toe is mainly enjoyed by children. Tic-tac-toe can be made significantly more complex by increasing the size of the board to 4 x 4, 5 x 5, or even up to a 20 x 20 grid.



## Gameplay
The goal of tic-tac-toe is to be the first player to get three in a row on a 3 x 3 grid, or four in a row in a 4 x 4 grid.  

To start, one player draws a board, creating a grid of squares, usually 3 x 3 or 4 x 4.

The player who is playing "X" always goes first. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either one player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally; or all nine squares are filled.

If a player is able to draw three of their Xs or three of their Os in a row, then that player wins.
